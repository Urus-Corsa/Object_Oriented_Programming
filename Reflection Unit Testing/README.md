Refliction Test program utilizes ReflectionTestUtils for automated unit testing of setters and getters methods of Address.java and Person.java classes. 
These two classes contain getters and setters methods in order to store and retrieve address information of different people in an application. 
This is to ensure protection and ability to safely manipulate the data as needed by providing data encapsulation. 
ReflectionTest.java class unitly invokes the getters and setters whiting both classes at runtime to ensure correction in execution and operation of each method.
